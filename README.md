LSTM Stock Price Prediction
Overview
This project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical market data. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning and remembering over long sequences of data, making them ideal for time series forecasting, such as stock price prediction.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the historical stock price data used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
src/: Source code for the LSTM model, data preprocessing, and utility functions.
models/: Saved LSTM model files and training logs.
results/: Graphs, charts, and other visualizations showing model performance.

Data
The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock prices, including open, close, high, low, and volume data. This data is used to train and test the LSTM model. Data preprocessing steps include normalization, feature selection, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Model
The LSTM model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies in the stock price data. The architecture includes:

Input Layer: Takes in sequences of stock prices for a given time window.
LSTM Layers: One or more LSTM layers that process the sequences.
Dense Layer: A fully connected layer to output the predicted stock price.
Activation: A linear activation function for the final output.
Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function. Training involves feeding sequences of stock price data into the model and adjusting the weights to minimize prediction errors. The training process includes:

Splitting Data: The data is divided into training and testing sets, typically using an 80-20 split.
Normalization: Feature scaling is applied to ensure that the model trains effectively.
Training Epochs: The model is trained over multiple epochs, with each epoch involving a forward pass and backpropagation to update the model weights.
Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Visualizations are also generated to compare predicted vs. actual stock prices.

Usage
To train the model with your own data:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
Modify the data preprocessing steps in src/preprocess.py if necessary.
Train the model by running the script in src/train.py.
Evaluate the model using src/evaluate.py and view the results in the results/ directory.
Results
After training, the model's predictions are visualized and compared to the actual stock prices. These visualizations help in understanding the model's accuracy and areas where it might need improvement.
